## About Quiltr

[Quiltr](https://rhjones.github.io/quiltr/) lets users generate random geometric quilt patterns in a range of sizes and color schemes. Users can save patterns to their "favorites" and browse a gallery of all patterns on the site. Users can also create projects based on these patterns and share their notes about and photos of each project.

Quiltr is built in Ember and relies on a Rails API/Postgres to persist data. Code for that API can be found at [rhjones/quiltr-api](https://github.com/rhjones/quiltr-api).
